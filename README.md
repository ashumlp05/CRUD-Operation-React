# React CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React. It demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations, including creating, viewing, editing, and deleting data.


# Features

<li>Add new records</li>
<li>View a list of records</li>
<li>Edit existing records</li>
<li>Delete records</li>
<li>Responsive design</li>
<li>State management using React hooks (useState, useEffect)</li>


# Technologies Used
<li>React: Frontend framework </li> 
<li> CSS: For basic styling (or mention any CSS framework used) </li> 



## Usage

 <li>Create: Fill out the form and click the "Add" button to create a new entry.</li>

<li>Read: The list of entries will be displayed on the homepage.</li>

 <li> Update:Click the "Edit" button next to any entry to update its details.</li>

<li> Delete: Click the "Delete" button to remove an entry.</li>



#  Future Enhancements

<li>Add a backend for persistent data storage: Currently, the data is stored in the application state, which means the entries will be lost on a page refresh.</li>

<li>Implement form validation: Add validation to the forms to ensure required fields are filled, and correct data is submitted.</li>

<li>Integrate with an API for external data: Connect the application to an API to fetch and store data dynamically.</li>
